# Cost of Living Dashboard

Cost of Living Dashboard is an Android application designed to help users monitor and analyze their personal expenses alongside public cost-of-living indicators such as inflation and rent trends. The goal of the project is to provide a single place where individuals can view both their own spending data and broader economic information so that they can make informed financial decisions.

## Project Idea

Many people struggle to keep track of rising living expenses and how those changes impact their personal budgets. This project aims to create an easy-to-use dashboard that combines:

- **Personal expenses** entered by the user.
- **Local market trends** such as price changes in groceries or utilities.
- **Inflation and rent indices** retrieved from public sources.

By aggregating these data points, the app offers real-time insights into how costs are evolving and where the user's money is going. Historical data is stored locally so the app can display trends over time, provide simple analytics, and send alerts when significant changes occur.

## End Goal

The ultimate objective of Cost of Living Dashboard is to empower users with actionable information about their finances. The app is intended to:

1. Present a clear overview of day-to-day spending.
2. Compare personal expenses with city or region level statistics.
3. Help users set budgeting goals and track progress toward them.
4. Give warnings or recommendations when costs change dramatically.

With these features, students, professionals, and families can better understand their cost of living and plan accordingly.
