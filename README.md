This project centers around the creation of a per
sonalized Android dashboard where users can track and analyze
 their rising cost of living in a dynamic urban environment. The
 app fetches and analyzes information from various sources like
 local market price trends, inflationary indices, rent changes, and
 the daily expenses entered by the users. Consolidating all such
 information with the app means that users can get their data-driven
 real-time insights on their financial well-being. The dashboard
 features a clean, minimalistic, and interactive user interface for
 all users to access and use with ease. The application targets
 students, working professionals, and families who want to see
 their spending patterns, set goals toward budgeting, and receive
 alerts on noteworthy changes in their economic situation in their
 vicinity. Besides, trend predictions, based on historical data, cost
 optimization personalization, and comparison tools to assess one
 area against another or one city against another are available. The
 overarching vision is to offer users with the necessary information
 and tools to make decisions that affect their lifestyle and financial
 planning in an increasingly volatile economic landscape.
